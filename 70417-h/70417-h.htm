</div>


<p>Owing to the difficulty of obtaining foreign made dyes, a revision
of the first edition of this publication has been made necessary.</p>

<p>As the result of an exhaustive series of tests of the products of
the National Aniline &amp; Chemical Company, Incorporated, New York
City, it is now possible to recommend a number of American made
dyes suitable for the tinting of motion picture film, and those recommended
in this book are in most cases equal in every respect to those
previously obtained abroad.</p>

<p>To date, it has not been possible to obtain a thoroughly satisfactory
blue dye, film tinted with the Cine Blue recommended being
too red, especially before drying. A more suitable dye will no doubt
be available in due course.</p>

<p>The number of sample tints has been curtailed to twelve, and
these are given merely for guidance. It is intended that the various
formulas should be altered to suit individual requirements.</p>

<p>The chapter on toning has been thoroughly revised, a number
of tones having been eliminated and others substituted. The formula
for the copper tone has been improved, while the formulas for
green tones requiring the use of vanadium chloride have been eliminated
in view of the expense and difficulty of obtaining satisfactory
vanadium chloride. With the samples at present on the market it
has not been possible to prepare a single-solution toning bath which
would keep for any reasonable length of time.</p>

<p>Attention is drawn to the new method of dye toning<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> recently
worked out in our Research Laboratory. This consists in first treating
the film in the copper toning bath and then immersing the washed
film in a solution of a basic dye, the dye attaching itself to the image
and leaving the gelatine clear. Although specific directions are
given for obtaining five tones only by this method, as further dyes
are available, those suitable for toning purposes will be published in
due course.</p>

<p>The method of producing sulphide tones has been changed to one
of simple re-development with sodium sulphide, the addition of hypo
to the sulphide solution having been eliminated. By commencing
with thin positive film of the correct density, and using a plain
solution of sodium sulphide for re-development, satisfactory transparent
tones are obtainable with precision.</p>

<p>The formulas for the iron and uranium tones are the same as
in the first edition.</p>

Film</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">In the production of motion picture film it is becoming more
common to vary the color of the film either by toning
or tinting or by a combination of the two processes. Toning
consists in either wholly or partially replacing the silver
image of the positive film by some colored compound, the
clear portions or highlights of the image, consisting of plain
gelatine, remaining unaffected and colorless. Tinting, on the
other hand, consists of immersing the film in a solution of
dye which colors the gelatine itself, causing the whole picture
on the screen to have a veil of color over it.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Part I.</span><br>
TINTING</h2>
</div>

<p>In “tinting” the following factors must be taken into
consideration:</p>


<p class="no-indent fs120">Nature of the Dye Employed</p>

<p>Dyes are chemically of two different types, acid and
basic; so-called acid dyes are the alkali salts of organic
acids, while basic dyes are the chlorides, sulphates, etc., of
organic bases.</p>

<p>For the tinting of film only “acid” dyes have been
considered since it is not possible to make a complete selection
from basic dyes alone, which would necessitate the use
of acid and basic dyes in admixture—a procedure highly
undesirable and in many cases impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Any dye suitable for admixture with others to produce
intermediate tints should possess the following properties:</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The dye should be inert and not attack the gelatine
or support. This is of fundamental importance as the
gelatine coating of dyed film in many cases has a tendency
to lose its flexibility, giving rise to what is known in the
trade as “brittleness.”</p>

<p>Several dyes when employed at a concentration of 1%
attack gelatine readily at 70 degrees F. and vigorously at
80 degrees F., especially in presence of small amounts of
acid, producing a marked softening and often partial dissolution
of the film. The effect is roughly proportional
to the concentration of the dye and to the temperature, and
varies with each individual dye.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the gelatine coating of film
which has been softened in this way by the dye becomes
“brittle” on subsequent projection.</p>

<p>The actual factors in the production of brittleness are:</p>

<p>1. The hydrolysing action of acid which in many cases
is added to assist dyeing. In case a solid acid is employed
the heat encountered during projection will greatly accelerate
this hydrolysis.</p>

<p>2. The corrosive action of the dye itself. Dyes vary
considerably in this respect according to their particular
composition. So far, it has not been possible to make
any general classification of dyes in this connection, though
nitro compounds appear to be particularly corrosive in their
action.</p>

<p>3. The presence of impurities in the dye. These take
the form of excessive amounts of loading material such
as sodium sulphate or chloride, or small traces of iron, the
latter having a tendency to harden the film considerably.</p>

<p>In all the above cases, the physical nature of the gelatine
is altered, whereby it loses its property of remaining resilient
under normal conditions of temperature and humidity, resulting
in “brittleness.”</p>

<p>A suitable test as to whether a dye has any propensity
to produce brittleness is to incubate a sample of film, half
of which has been dyed, for about 48 hours at 212 degrees F.
If any difference in brittleness is noticeable between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
dyed and the undyed portions so treated after the film has
been allowed to stand in the air for some time, the dye is
unsuitable for tinting.</p>

<p>Apart from the above, most dyes when used at a concentration
of 1% and at 80 degrees F. produce more or
less softening of the gelatine, which may be prevented by:</p>

<p>(a) Use of only dilute solutions. Except in very
special cases, a dye solution stronger than 0.5% is seldom
required, the usual strength employed being about 0.2%, at
which concentration softening is unusual.</p>

<p>(b) Use of a minimum amount of volatile acid in the
dye-bath or omission of the same whenever possible.</p>

<p>(c) By working at temperatures not higher than 70
degrees F.</p>

<p>(d) By slight hardening of the film before dyeing and
subsequent softening by glycerine, as described below:</p>

<p><em>B.</em> The dye should not “bleed” to any considerable
extent when the film is washed; in other words, the rate
of removal of the dye should be slow and only a slight
amount should wash out in a period of, say, five minutes.</p>

<p>In tinting, bleeding is of very considerable importance,
since, during the periods between rinsing after dyeing and
the placing of the film on the drying rack, any drops of
water on the surface of the film become more or less
saturated with dye, and these after drying remain as spots
and irregular markings which are very apparent on the
screen.</p>

<p>It is possible in some cases to modify this bleeding by an
acid “stop bath,” or by adding acid to the dye-bath; though
it may be considered a general rule that the bleeding of a dye
is a property peculiar to itself. In making a selection of
dyes therefore, it is necessary to choose only those whose
propensity for bleeding is a minimum.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> The rate of dyeing should be only slightly affected
by the addition of acid to the dye-bath, although most acid
dyes are more or less sensitive to acid.</p>

<p>In case the rate of dyeing is appreciably affected by the
addition of acid it is possible to take advantage of this fact
since a much weaker dye solution may be employed to
obtain a given tint, while an apparently exhausted bath may
be revived by adding a small trace of acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Only a volatile acid such as acetic acid should be used
since this will evaporate on drying, while the strength of
the acid in the dye-bath should not exceed .05% or one
part in 2000, otherwise softening of the gelatine is liable
to occur, especially if the temperature exceeds 70° F.</p>

<p>In the case of a bath containing a mixture of dyes, owing
to the fact that acid affects some dyes more than others, as
the dye-bath becomes exhausted and the acid content
changes, the tint obtained will gradually change also. It is
only possible therefore to use acid with any degree of certainty
in the case of dye-baths containing a single dye.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> The dyes should not fade on exposure to heat or
light and should not be “dichroic” or change color on
dilution.</p>

<p><em>Moreover, the wear and tear of the film should not be
impaired in any way after dyeing, and even after incubating
for 48 hours at 212 degrees F., afterwards allowing the film
to humidify, no difference should be discernible between
dyed and undyed film so treated.</em></p>

<p><em>E.</em> The dye should not be affected by the acid fixing
bath since any fixing solution accidentally splashed thereon,
would destroy the dye immediately.</p>

<p>In view of the large number of tints required in commercial
work, it is undesirable to keep a separate dye-powder
for the preparation of each particular bath, but rather to
prepare the same by admixture of three or more dyes. If
three only are employed, mixing must be conducted with
great precision in order to reproduce any given tint, but this
difficulty is removed by the use of intermediate colors.</p>

<p>The following six standard dyes have been chosen as
fulfilling the above conditions as nearly as possible, and by
suitably mixing solutions of these, almost any desired tint
may be obtained.</p>

<p>These dyes are obtainable from the National Aniline &amp;
Chemical Co., Inc., New York City.</p>

<p>The strength of the dyes may vary slightly from batch
to batch, but this variation is usually so small as not to
materially affect the nature of the tint obtained from any
particular formula.</p>

<p>The Cine Blue dye appears much redder by artificial
light than by daylight, especially before drying the film, as
do all tints containing Cine Blue.</p>

<p class="no-indent fs130">Method of Mixing</p>

<p>Dissolve the solid dyes in as small an amount of hot
water as possible, and filter through fine muslin. Pour hot
water over any residue remaining, which should only be
slight, in order to ensure thorough solution of the dye, and
dilute the solution in the tank to the required volume at 65
degrees F.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Nature of Positive Film</p>

<p>Only good snappy positive film may be successfully
tinted, since tinting tends to reduce contrast.</p>

<p>The depth of the tint obtained depends on the following
factors:</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Nature and Strength of the Dye-bath</p>

<p>Except in special cases such as fire scenes, sunset and
moonlight effects, and the like, it is very undesirable to
employ strong tints, since apart from the displeasing effect
and irritation to the eye, the dyes produce a slight softening
of the gelatine film when used at 80 degrees F. in
1% solution.</p>

<p>Should it be necessary to employ concentrated baths in
summer, either cool the dye-bath or use a suitable hardener.
This will be unnecessary if hardener is employed in the
fixing bath after development, but otherwise if formalin
(40%) be added to the dye-bath to the extent of 1 volume
to 400 volumes of dye solution, no trouble will be encountered.
During the winter months, when it is advisable to
treat all film after developing and fixing, with glycerine,
the latter may be incorporated with the dye-bath, thereby
eliminating an extra operation. The strength of the
glycerine should be 2%, or two volumes per one hundred
volumes of dye solution. In most cases, however, the addition
of glycerine considerably retards the rate of dyeing, so
that in order to obtain the same degree of tinting within a
period of ten minutes, the concentration of the dye-bath
should be increased accordingly.</p>

<p>When delicate tints are employed, the effect is both to
remove the contrasty black and white effect, and to add a
touch of warmth to the black deposit of silver, even in cases
where the highlights are insufficiently stained to be noticeable.
The result in many cases is equal to that obtained
by partial toning, for example, tint No. 11 gives the effect
of a blue-black tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Temperature of Dye-bath</p>

<p>Although temperature has little effect on the rate of
dyeing with the dyes recommended, when used without the
addition of acid it is advisable in all cases to work at 65 to
70 degrees F. in order to produce uniform results and remove
any danger of softening the film.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Time of Dyeing</p>

<p>In order to duplicate any particular tint with a given
dye-bath the film may be dyed either by time or by inspection.
Dyeing by time is reliable if the dye-bath does not contain
acid, though if acid is present, in time the acidity decreases,
causing a slowing down of the rate of dyeing so that it
becomes necessary to judge the progress of dyeing by
inspection.</p>

<p>If two or more tints of the same color are required, in
order to reduce the number of individual dye-baths to a
minimum, it is better to vary the time of dyeing rather than
to vary the dilution of the bath, providing the time of dyeing
for the lighter tint is not less than one minute, which
time is considered a minimum for the production of uniform
results and for complete control of the dyeing operations.</p>

<p>The time of dyeing also depends somewhat on the previous
handling of the film. Film which has been fixed in a
bath containing ordinary, or chrome alum, dyes more
quickly than that treated with plain hypo and hardened with
formalin.</p>

<p>It is probable therefore, that small traces of alum are
left in the film even after prolonged washing, which serve
as a mordant for the dye.</p>

<p>The film samples herewith shown were fixed in the
regular acid hypo bath, so that if for any reason the tints
indicated are not obtained in the time stated, then either
the time of dyeing or the dilution of the dye-bath should be
altered accordingly.</p>

<p>Should the film for any reason be over-dyed, a small
portion of the dye may be removed by washing for 10 to 15
minutes, though the nature of the dyes will permit only
slight mistakes to be rectified in this manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Life of the Dye-baths</p>

<p>This averages about 40,000 feet per 50 gallons of dye-bath.
The baths may be revived at intervals by the addition
of more dye, though this procedure is uncertain and it is
generally advisable to mix fresh solution.</p>

<p>The addition of a trace of acetic acid (1 part in 1000)
will revive an apparently exhausted bath though as stated
above, it is only advisable to do this in the case of baths
containing a single dye.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Method of Procedure</p>

<p>Either the “drum” or “rack” method may be employed,
and in either case after dyeing for ten minutes (during which
time the drum or rack should be agitated to ensure even
dyeing and prevent accumulation of air bubbles) the film
should be given a thorough rinse in plain water.</p>

<p>Before drying films on racks it is advisable to set the
rack at a slight angle for a few minutes, to enable the surplus
water to drain off more readily through the perforations.
If drums are used for drying it is advisable to remove the
surplus water by whirling the drum previous to drying.</p>

<p>If uniform results are to be obtained, film should never
be passed through the projector before either tinting or
toning.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">How to Obtain Intermediate Tints</p>

<p>The twelve tints above are given merely as examples;
other tints may be readily obtained by making a trial with a
small amount of solution on a short length of film, taking
care to match the tint in artificial light and not by daylight,
since any dye containing Cine Blue appears redder by artificial
light than by daylight.</p>

<p>When matching think of the tint as being made up of
one or more of the colors, red, yellow, and blue. Colors
such as orange are made by mixing yellow and red, violet
by mixing red and blue, and green by mixing yellow and
blue. Browns are obtained by mixing all three colors red,
yellow, and blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>When comparing any two particular tints, it is usual to
say that one is redder, yellower or bluer than the other, and
the two may therefore be matched accordingly.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Choice of Tint</p>

<p>Almost any tint if delicate may be employed with advantage,
though for general use those ranging through pink,
rose, orange, yellow, pale green and pale blue are to be
recommended; others are for special purposes.</p>

<p>It is always desirable to obtain harmony in color,
especially when combining tinting with toning, so that the
combination is pleasing to the normal eye.</p>

<p>For local tinting and hand coloring, the above dyes are
likewise satisfactory.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs130"><span class="smcap">Troubles in Tinting</span></p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Streaks and Uneven Coloring</p>

<p>Cause</p>

<p>a. Grease on the film. Never project film before tinting.</p>

<p>b. Slight bleeding and insufficient squeegeeing when on
the drying rack. Always carefully remove any surface
moisture from the film with a damp chamois, before drying.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Sludge in the Dye-bath</p>

<p>This is due to the precipitation of the dye by small traces
of alum or iron in the water supply. In many localities
water is purified by adding alum, and only the smallest trace
need be present to throw some of the dye out of solution.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Frothing of the Dye-bath</p>

<p>This occurs only when tinting on the drum with Cine
Scarlet, Cine Orange, and Cine Green, but no inconvenience
will be caused if the drum is revolved slowly.</p>

TONING</h2>
</div>

<p>As distinct from tinting, a toned image consists of a
color image embedded within a layer of colorless gelatine,
so that while the highlights are clear, the shadows are
colored.</p>

<p>The coloring matter may consist of an inorganic colored
compound or a dye, or of a mixture of both, and by wholly
or partially replacing the black and white silver image by
one or more of these substances, a colored image is produced.</p>

<p>It is, of course, important that the colored compound
should be as transparent as possible so that the full tone
will be apparent on projection. In this respect, while some
samples of toned film appear colored in the hand, they produce
a substantially black and white image on projection, so
that when judging any particular tone, it is absolutely necessary
to view the image on the screen.</p>

<p>Of the various inorganic colored compounds, the metallic
ferrocyanides are the most suitable for toning purposes of
which:</p>

<p>
Iron (ferric) ferrocyanide is blue,<br>
Copper ferrocyanide is red, and<br>
Uranium ferrocyanide is reddish brown.<br>
</p>

<p>It is the object in toning to replace the metallic silver
composing the image more or less by one of the above
compounds or by a mixture of these. In this way intermediate
tones are obtained.</p>

<p>Toning may be effected either by a single solution process
or a two solution process.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Two Solution Process</p>

<p>This consists of first converting the silver image into
silver ferrocyanide by a suitable bleaching bath, thoroughly
washing, and acting upon the ferrocyanide image with a
metallic salt, usually in presence of an acid, the metallic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
ferrocyanide being produced by double decomposition. The
reaction, however, is never complete, so that the image is
mixed with undecomposed silver ferrocyanide which tends
to make the image opaque, but at the same time it also adds
“body” to the latter. Providing allowance is made in the
original positive for this intensification, good tones are
obtained. (See Tone G.)</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Single Solution Process</p>

<p>Instead of the two separate baths used above, a single
solution may be employed consisting of a metallic ferricyanide
dissolved in a suitable solvent (say, an alkali salt
of citric, tartaric, or oxalic acids) in presence of an acid
and certain other salts.</p>

<p>On immersion of the positive film in this solution the
silver image is converted to silver ferrocyanide, while the
colored ferrocyanide is formed simultaneously and combined
with it.</p>

<p>In either of the above cases in view of the fact that the
metallic ferrocyanide is deposited in a colloidal condition in
presence of the gelatine of the film, its state of division and
the nature of the tone are usually affected by the presence
of certain salts, changes of temperature, concentration of
the baths and other factors which must be maintained constant
in order to obtain uniform results. With such single
baths it is possible to secure tones which are unobtainable
by a two solution process, though as such single solutions are
sensitive to light and rapidly attack foreign metals which
may be present in the shape of faucets, etc., such solutions
are comparatively unstable and require care in their use.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dye Toning</span></h3>

<p>Owing to the limited number of colored inorganic compounds
available for toning purposes, it is possible to obtain
only a limited range of tones by the above methods.</p>

<p>In view of the possible wide range of colors obtainable
by the use of dyes, it has long been considered that a
satisfactory method of producing a dye image would be the
ideal method for toning purposes.</p>

<p>As a result of recent work in our Research Laboratory,
it is now possible to recommend such a method of toning
which depends upon the fact that certain inorganic compounds,
including copper ferrocyanide, have the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
of mordanting certain basic dyes, so that when they are
immersed in a solution of the dye the latter attaches itself
to the mordant, which in turn becomes colored.</p>

<p>The most suitable dyes for dye toning are those which
do not readily dye gelatine so that on immersing, say, a
sample of copper toned film in a weak solution of the dye
containing a little acid, the dye becomes mordanted to the
image, while the highlights consisting of clear gelatine remain
colorless, the resulting tone being a combination of the
color of the toned film and the dye.</p>

<p>Full particulars are given under tones J, K, L, M and N.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Nature of the Positive to be Toned</p>

<p>Since most toning processes either intensify or reduce the
original image, in order to obtain uniform results, <em>commence
toning with positive film of the correct density</em>.</p>

<p>Three standards of positive film have been chosen: Thin,
Medium and Normal. (See chart.) The “Thin” and
“Medium” standards are obtained by giving a slight overexposure
and a shorter time of development.</p>

<p>The exact degree of intensification which takes place
in any particular case will soon be learned after a few trials.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Nature of the Developer</p>

<p>Any good Elon-Hydrochinon, Kodelon-Hydrochinon, or
straight Hydrochinon formula will give satisfactory tones,
though in the case of Tone G an Elon-Hydrochinon developer
is essential in order that a rich olive color may be
obtained.</p>

<p>For toning, it is necessary that the developed film should
be entirely free from fog, since a thin veil becomes intensified
in most of the toning processes. Fog may be caused by:</p>

<p>(a) Oxidation of the developer, noticeable by the brown
coloration produced after continued use. The remedy is to
renew the developer.</p>

<p>(b) Carelessness in compounding the developer. The
usual mistake consists in adding the carbonate to the Elon
and Hydrochinon without previously adding a portion of
sulphite to prevent oxidation. It is not advisable, however,
to add the whole of the sulphite to the Elon and Hydrochinon
in the first place, otherwise the Elon may precipitate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Mixing the developer with water which is too warm will
often cause fog.</p>

<p>(c) The presence of copper, brass, and tin, the fumes
from sodium sulphide, etc., in the developing baths are to be
strictly avoided. A salt of copper if present only to the
extent of one part in 10,000 will produce fog on cine positive
film.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Fixing</p>

<p>This operation should be complete and, if possible,
carried out in two consecutive baths and followed by thorough
washing, otherwise uneven coloring will result.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate any possibility of uneven toning it
is always advisable to tone immediately after washing and
before drying.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Control in Toning</p>

<p>As in the case of tinting, the nature of the tone obtained
with the various solutions depends on the following factors:</p>

<p>a. <em>The nature and dilution of the toning solutions.</em>
Except in those cases where it is recommended to revive the
bath by adding more acid, it is not advisable to modify
the composition or dilution of the various solutions, as these
have been adjusted to give the best results.</p>

<p>b. <em>Temperature of toning.</em></p>

<p>In most cases a change of temperature from 60 to 70
degrees F. has merely the effect of changing the time of
toning. It is advisable, however, to maintain the temperature
of the various solutions between 65 degrees and 70
degrees F.</p>

<p>c. <em>Time of toning.</em></p>

<p>Except in the case of tones F and G when toning
proceeds to a limit, the nature of the tone produced varies
with the time of toning, reaching a limit in from 10 to 15
minutes, so that in a shorter time intermediate tones are
produced. Since most of the toning processes intensify the
original image, if an intermediate tone is required, it is
usually necessary to commence toning with denser film than
when toning is to be carried to the limit. See tones B, C
and D.</p>

<p>When producing intermediate tones, it is therefore
possible either to tone in the normal bath for a given time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
or in a diluted bath for a longer time. In order to reduce
the number of individual toning baths to a minimum it is
recommended to vary the time of toning rather than to vary
the dilution of the bath and to judge the tone by inspection.
Since the strength of the toning bath falls off with use,
inspection is necessary in all cases except Tones F and G.</p>

<p>Before commencing work with any bath, it is advisable
to make a test on a short length of film.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Permanency of Tones</p>

<p>The permanency of the tones produced largely depends
on the care exercised throughout the various operations.</p>

<p>The silver sulphide image may be considered permanent,
though in the other cases, where more or less silver ferrocyanide
is present, the toned image is not absolutely permanent,
being somewhat soluble in hypo and affected by fumes
of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>In the case of the iron and uranium tones, the colored
ferrocyanides are dissolved by alkali such as sodium carbonate,
so that the toned film should not be washed for too
long a time in water which is at all inclined to be alkaline.</p>

<p>In no case however, if the instructions are carefully
followed will the toned image deteriorate during the active
life of the film. Moreover, so far as can be ascertained,
the wear and tear of film which has been toned by the
methods recommended is in no way impaired, though by
virtue of the hardening action of most of the toning baths
on the gelatine it is advisable, especially during the winter
months, to immerse the film for three or four minutes in
the usual 2% glycerine bath after toning.</p>

<p>Should film have to be stored for long periods of time,
toning is inadvisable, nor is it advisable to tone valuable
film unless duplicates are available.</p>

<p>The <em>life</em> of the toning bath has been carefully investigated
in each case, the term “life” being considered as the total
length of film capable of being toned by a given volume
of fresh solution when toning is conducted continuously
and without interruption.</p>

<p>In all cases it is false economy to exhaust a toning bath
to the limit and thus obtain inferior tones, since the cost of
the chemicals employed is insignificant compared with the
value of the film being treated.</p>

<p>Since the figures given represent the capacity of the bath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
for toning under the best conditions, they only apply providing
the baths are kept covered as far as possible when
not in use, to exclude light, and providing no foreign
metallic surface, however small, is allowed to come into
contact with the solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, single solution baths are not intended
for occasional use. In such cases two-solution
methods should as far as possible be employed, although it
has only been possible to recommend the latter for the
production of sulphide and blue-green tones.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Stability of the Solutions</p>

<p>All toning solutions containing potassium ferricyanide
are sensitive to light, the ferricyanide being reduced to ferrocyanide.
Therefore when not in use the tanks should be
carefully covered so as to screen the solutions from sunlight.</p>

<p>It is also very important that no metallic surface however
small should come in contact with the solutions; any
metal pegs on the racks or pins used to hold the film together
will gather the tone in preference to the film, causing the
formation of sludge. Plain wooden racks with or without
wooden pegs should be used, and metal faucets replaced by
wooden plugs.</p>

<p>If any considerable amount of sludge forms in the tank
at any time, it is due either to incorrect mixing, the action
of light, or to the presence of foreign metallic substances.</p>

<p>Dissolve each ingredient separately in as little water as
possible, mix the filtered solutions so obtained in the order

should be light green in color and perfectly clear.
The ammonium carbonate should be almost transparent and
free from white powder, and should be dissolved in cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
water, while the ammonium citrate employed should be
neutral. Most samples contain acid, which acid would
neutralize the ammonium carbonate and affect the resulting
tone. The free acid is usually citric acid, and should be
neutralized with a solution of ammonia using litmus as
indicator.</p>

<p><em>Temperature of Toning</em>—To obtain the best results the

weaker by virtue of the loss of copper, though 50 gallons of
the solution will tone about 10,000 feet of film.</p>

<p>It is necessary to keep the film entirely submerged in
the tank, or constantly in motion when on the drum, otherwise

<p class="no-indent">Mix in the order given. The solution obtained should be
perfectly clear and pale yellow in color.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the nature of the tone is influenced
largely by the acid content, it is very important
that the uranium nitrate should contain no free acid, and
this may be assured by neutralizing a solution with dilute
ammonia until a slight permanent precipitate is obtained.</p>

<p>It is convenient to keep stock solutions of the above
(say, 10% solutions) from which a new bath may be
expeditiously compounded. A 10% hydrochloric acid solution
is one containing 10 parts by volume of the concentrated
acid per 100 volumes of the final solution.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Temperature of Toning</em>—65 degrees to 70 degrees F.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Time of Toning</em>—Ten minutes.</p>

<p>Since this and the following single solution methods of
toning produce a marked intensification of the silver image—which
intensification increases with the time of toning—it
follows that the nature of the tone changes with time also.</p>

<p>The composition of the bath has been so adjusted that
the maximum effect is produced in about 10 minutes, the
tone passing through a series of changes from brown to
red during this time.</p>

<p>It is therefore possible to obtain intermediate tones by
withdrawing the film from the bath at shorter intervals,
though in such cases the contrast of the original black and
white film should be adjusted accordingly, since with slight
toning very little intensification takes place. (See tones
C and D.)</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Time of Washing</em>—Ten to fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The highlights will become clear in the above time,
though a thin yellowish brown veil may remain in the clear
gelatine as a result of the intensification of minute traces
of fog, but this has no effect on projection. If the bath is
working correctly the yellowish veil is only just perceptible,
but if appreciably visible, then either the film was fogged
during development, or the bath was not compounded correctly.
Washing should not be carried out for too long a
period, especially with water inclined to be alkaline, because
the toned image is soluble in alkali.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Life of Bath</em></p>

<p>Fifty gallons of solution will tone about 5000 feet of
film without any appreciable change in the tone, after which
the rich tone tends to flatness as a result of a deficiency
of acid in the bath. At this point the bath may be revived
by the further addition of acid to the extent of the original
amount, when a further 5000 feet may be toned. At this
stage the richness of tone falls off rapidly and the bath
should be thrown away.</p>

<p>Used intermittently over a period of several days the
life of the bath is approximately the same.</p>

<p>With continued use a slight brownish flocculent precipitate
may form in the bath, but this should only be slight,
otherwise it is caused by incorrect mixing, the action of
light, or by contact with a metallic surface.</p>

Each of the solid chemicals should be dissolved separately
in a small quantity of warm water, the solutions allowed to
cool, filtered into the tank strictly in the order given, and
the whole diluted to the required volume. If these instructions
are followed, the bath will be a pale yellow color,

<p class="no-indent"><em>Time of Washing</em></p>

<p>Wash for ten to fifteen minutes until the highlights are

<p>The depth of the dye tone is determined by the time of

<p class="no-indent"><em>Tone N</em>—Copper-Iron-Dye Tone.</p>

<p>By first partially toning the black and white film
(Medium) in Tone A for three to four minutes at 65 degrees
to 70 degrees F., so that the half-tones are completely toned
but the shadows only partially, washing for ten minutes
and then completing the toning process in the blue toning
bath H, the residual silver in the shadows is toned blue.
In this way a double tone is obtained, the shadows appearing
dark blue and the half-tones reddish brown.</p>

<p>By immersing the film toned in this manner in the
Chrysoidin dye-bath as given under Tone K, the dye is
mordanted to the half-tones which contain copper ferrocyanide,
producing the effect indicated.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Combined Tinting and Toning</p>

<p>In many cases pleasing effects may be obtained by tinting
film which has already been toned, the result being that the
clear portions or highlights assume the color of the dye,
while the shadows and half-tones project a tint intermediate
between that of the dye and the toned deposit.</p>

<p>Considerable judgment is necessary, however, in choosing
suitable tints to blend with any given tone.</p>

<p>The most successful combination of toning with tinting
is in the production of sunset and moonlight effects over
water, by first toning blue and then tinting orange, red or
yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The following combinations will cover most cases required:</p>

<p>Tones A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K, L. Tints Nos. 2, 5, 6.</p>

<p>Tones G, H, I. Tint almost any delicate shade.</p>

<p>It is considered unnecessary to illustrate every combination
of tone and tint above, so that only typical examples
are given. It must be noted that toned film (except tones
A and F) absorbs the dye more quickly than untoned film,
so in order to duplicate appended samples, the dye-baths
should be diluted accordingly.</p>

<p>Very pleasing effects may also be obtained by locally
tinting toned film, the color being applied either by hand
with a brush, or by stencilling.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Equipment</p>

<p>The equipment necessary for systematic tinting and
toning is essentially the same as that required for development,
consisting of the usual tanks and racks or small
drums, only it is advisable that they should be used for
this purpose exclusively and, if possible, occupy a separate
room to exclude any possibility of contaminating the developing
solutions by the copper or sulphiding bath, which
would cause development fog immediately.</p>

<p>The “drum” system, on account of the expense involved
in apparatus and the larger space required for manipulation,
is not to be recommended for tinting and toning operations,
though for operation on a small scale, a small wooden drum
revolving in a shallow wooden tank is most efficient and
economical.</p>

<p>When the tank and rack system is employed, the tanks
should be of slate or other resistive material, and have an
outlet at the bottom in the form of a hard-rubber stopcock
or a plain wooden plug. The racks or drums may be of
wood, but if metal pegs are employed on the racks they
should be coated with acid-resisting paint such as asphalt,
since the presence of any metallic surface in the toning baths
will cause contamination and effect a precipitation of sludge.
The frames should not be interchanged but kept separate
either for tinting or toning to prevent contamination of one
bath with racks previously employed in another. This also
applies to the small drum system. For instance, a pink tint
would be ruined by using a rack which had previously been
immersed in a deep blue dye-bath, unless that particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
rack had been thoroughly washed. In the case of delicate
tinting, however, no harm is done providing the racks
have been previously coated with the following waterproof
varnish:</p>


<table class="autotable fs90" style="width: 70%">

<td class="tdr">10</td>
<td class="tdl">gals.</td>
<td class="tdr">40</td>
<td class="tdl">liters</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Before treatment it is preferable to immerse the racks
which have been previously used for developing, in a 1%
solution of hydrochloric acid for two or three minutes, wash
for fifteen minutes and thoroughly dry. The well-dried
racks are then dipped in the above solution and the excess
liquid drained off, when the varnish dries almost immediately.
The varnishing should be repeated at intervals.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Mixing Solutions</p>

<p>Developers, toning solutions and dyes should be mixed
in crocks of glazed earthenware or enameled iron, using
warm water where necessary and ensuring thorough solution
by stirring with a wooden paddle, which should be thoroughly
washed after each operation. Having thus dissolved
the chemicals in as small a quantity of warm water as
possible, filter through fine muslin and make up the bath
with cold water, so that the final solution will be at approximately
the correct temperature.</p>

<p>The chemicals employed should be pure (for the samples,
“EKCo.” tested chemicals were used), and in cases where a
good water supply is not available, only distilled water
should be used.</p>


<p class="no-indent fs130">Troubles in Toning</p>

<p>Most difficulties met with in toning may be traced to one
or more of the following causes:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Uneven Toning</em></p>

<p>This may be due to:</p>

<p>a. Grease on the film. Never project film before tinting
or toning.</p>

<p>b. Drying spots on untoned film. If possible, always
tint or tone film immediately after washing and before
drying.</p>

<p>c. Examination of the film too frequently during toning,
causes an oxidation of the toning solution in places where
the solution fails to drain from the film.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>d. Insufficient or uneven washing of the film after
bleaching and before toning (Tones F and G).</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>White Spots</em></p>

<p>White spots are produced by particles of hypo or carbonate
dust or splashes of a solution of these, settling on
the toned film. The toned image consists of silver together
with more or less silver ferrocyanide and the ferrocyanides
of uranium, iron and copper as the case may be. Silver
ferrocyanide is soluble in hypo while uranium and iron
ferrocyanides are soluble in a solution of sodium carbonate,
strong ammonia, etc., so that the white spots indicate those
parts where the toned image has been dissolved away.</p>

<p>Irregular white spots may also be formed if the film is
imperfectly squeegeed after washing and before drying,
especially if the wash water is slightly alkaline. When a
spot of water on the toned film evaporates, the small amount
of alkali present in the water becomes more concentrated
and finally dissolves away more or less of the tone, leaving
a white spot on the film.</p>

<p>White spots due to these causes may be prevented by
immersing the film for a few seconds in a .5% solution of
glacial acetic acid after toning and before placing on the
drying rack.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Stained Highlights</em></p>

<p>Are caused by:</p>

<p>a. Traces of fog on the film before toning.</p>

<p>b. An improperly compounded toning bath. All solutions
when new should be perfectly clear.</p>

<p>c. Premature exhaustion of the bath. This is due either
to the action of light or to the presence of some metal in the
tank in the shape of screw heads, faucets, pins, etc., which
gather the tone and cause the formation of sludge.</p>

<p>It is important to keep all solutions containing potassium
ferricyanide exposed as little as possible to daylight, to use
only wooden racks with wooden pegs, and to cover all metal
parts very carefully with acid resisting paint.</p>

<p>d. In dye-toning, stained highlights are due either to
insufficient washing after toning with copper, too strong a
dye-bath, or an incorrect amount of acid in the dye-bath.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
